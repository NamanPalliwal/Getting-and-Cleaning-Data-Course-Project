The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition.

##Download the dataset
    Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset
    
##Assign each data to variables
    1. features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
          The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
    2. activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
          List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
    3. subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
          contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
